# Implement Data Structures using Rust from scratch and write unit tests for them

Currently have following data structures implemented:

- Singly Linked List
- Hash Map that uses Linked List to handle index collisions
- Stack (LIFO: Last-in First-out) that uses vector to hold data
- Queue (FIFO: First-in First-out) uses vector to hold data

This task help to understand how most common data structures work on the low level.
It also provides training for TDD or Test Driven Development that helps to write code one step at a time since methods are covered by unit tests.
